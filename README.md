# simd-softmax-vectorization-llvm
This project demonstrates SIMD-based acceleration of the softmax function using AVX for x86 and NEON for ARM architectures. It includes scalar and vectorized implementations, performance benchmarking, and correctness verification using PyTorch. Ideal for exploring compiler-level optimization strategies and low-level kernel tuning for ML workloads.
